2.3 Procedure

When A=B=C=0, D is 1 and E is 1.
When A=B=C=1, D is 1 and E is 0.

2.4 Submission Checklist

Set G3 to an XOR gate
If A=B=C=0, D is 1 and E is 1.
If A=B=C=1, D is 1 and E is 0.

3. The results are the same because in the cases that we set A,B,C
the results the same. We will get different results if A and B is not the same as C.
